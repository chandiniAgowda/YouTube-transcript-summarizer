# 📺 YouTube Summarizer - Mini NLP Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is designed to automatically summarize YouTube video transcripts, making it easier to grasp key points without watching the entire video. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), the system extracts transcripts, processes the text, and generates a concise summary. This tool is particularly useful for researchers, students, and professionals who want to quickly extract relevant information from educational or lengthy videos.  

## 🔧 Key Features  
- **Automated Transcript Extraction** – Retrieves video transcripts from YouTube.  
- **Text Preprocessing** – Cleans and structures raw text for analysis.  
- **Summarization Techniques** – Uses NLP-based extractive summarization to generate key insights.  
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple execution in Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation.  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- ** `video summarizer.ipynb`** – Contains the entire implementation.  
- **`README.md`** – Provides documentation on how to use the project.  

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Input the YouTube video URL for which you need a summary.  
3. Run the notebook to retrieve the transcript and generate a summary.  
4. View the extracted summary and key points from the video.  

## 🎯 Applications  
- **Educational Content Summarization** – Quickly grasp the essence of lectures or tutorials.  
- **Market Research & Analysis** – Extract insights from business-related videos.  
- **News & Media Summarization** – Get quick summaries of lengthy news discussions.  

## 🛠 Future Enhancements  
- Implement abstractive summarization for better context retention.  
- Develop a web interface for a more interactive user experience.  
- Support multiple languages for broader accessibility.
